    <p>
        API Access Claims are an important administrative service in OrderCloud.
        This service is where you will explicitly create each application instance and
        where you will define the scope of each application's access rights. Without this you would
        not be able to authenticate as a buyer user, which would prove troubling within your buyer
        applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        When processing a successful API Access Claim, an ID will be returned to you (of which
        you can optionally define in the request yourself) that will act as your applications
        <code>clientID</code>. This is what you will store in the base of your application as an app constant
        named <code>clientid</code>. This clientID is what the client application will use to tell OrderCloud
        what buyer environment it should be looking under when a user attempts to authenticate on the site.
    </p>

        A full API Access Request Object is shown below. We will only be using part of this object, as the
        <code>ClientSecret</code> is irrelevant for this call (we'll be using the administrative token stored
        in your browsers cookies for your current admin user), and <code>DefaultUserContextID</code> is an
        advanced topic we won't be touching on right now.

        You can read more about the code in the documentation, but for now just set your the <code>AppName</code>
        of your choosing and leave everything else the same. Note that the <code>AccessTokenDuration</code> and
        <code>RefreshTokenDuration</code> are in milliseconds, and you are currently making an application
        that has 'FullAccess' claims, which means that a buyer-user has the same level of access to the system
        as an admin user (they can create products, categories, users, etc., just like your admin user). Don't
        worry about access levels right now, as we are just focused on building a basic environment right now.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, go ahead and fill in the <code>AppName</code> value in the <code>claim</code>
        object and press submit.
