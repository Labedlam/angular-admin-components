    <p>
        In this class, we will be creating the final assignments necessary for your first catalog to be complete
        and your buyer user to gain access to the products you have created. This assignment is called a "Category Assignment", and creates the relationship between
        a user and a category. This is the binding assignment for a user to get access to a product through a
        category. Without it, a product assigned to a category is meaningless, and without a product assigned
        to a category, this assignment is meaningless. Together, they create the relationship that gives a user
        an indirect connection a product.

        Note: Don't forget about the Product Assignment you made in an earlier class between the product, price
        schedule, and group, as this is also required to make a product accessible to a user!

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating a Category Assignment</h3>
    <p>
        Similar to the Category Product Assignment, this is also a very simple object. In our case, we will
        only be using he <code>UserGroupID</code> and <code>CategoryID</code>. The UserID should be discarded since
        we are handling it at the Group level.This assignment has one idiosyncrasy that is unlike other assignment
        operations, in that if you do not provide a <code>UserID</code> or <code>UserGroupID</code>, it will assume
        that you are making the assignment at the buyer level (every user under the buyer will have access).
        Keep this in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, go ahead and set your <code>UserGroupID</code> and <code>CategoryID</code> (and make sure
        to remove the <code>UserID</code> value completely.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, go ahead and hit 'Run'!
