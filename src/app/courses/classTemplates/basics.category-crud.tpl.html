        Before we create the final necessary assignments, it is necessary that we create a category. Beyond
        providing a way to keep products organized and grouped, a category also acts as an access-point for
        buyer-users to access a product or set of products. A user can only access a product through a category
        that has the product assigned to it. Additionally, a user has to be assigned to that category in
        order to gain access to the product. In other words, there are two category assignments necessary to create an
        indirect relationship between a user and product.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before we get into those assignments, let's create a category that you will use for this
        exercise.
    </p>

    <h3 class="page-title">Create a Category</h3>
    <p>
        Below is a sample request object of a new Category,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 170px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.Categories.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Creating a category is much like creating a user--it must be defined under the context of a buyer,
        and requires a request object. Go ahead and set the <code class="var">buyerID</code> variable with the
        ID of the buyer you created in the first class. Now take a look at the <code class="var">cat</code>
        variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start by taking a few of the values we don't need out. Remove the <code>ParentID</code> and
        the second <code>XP</code> (the last value) values, as the the former is outside the scope of this course, and the latter
        isn't supposed to be in there (to be fixed). Then, go ahead and fill out the <code>ID</code>,
        <code>Name</code>, and <code>Description</code> out with anything you would like. You will also want to
        leave <code>xp</code> null, and <code>ListOrder</code> set to 1. Finally, set <code>Active</code> to true.
        This needs to be set to true or the category won't be accessible on a buyer application!
    </p>
    <p>
        You only need to create one category, so go ahead and run when you are ready!
