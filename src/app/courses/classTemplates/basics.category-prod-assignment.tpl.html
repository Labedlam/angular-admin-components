    <p>
        In this class, you will be creating the first of two assignments necessary for a buyer user to gain access
        to a product. This assignment is called a 'Category Product Assignment', and creates the relationship between
        a product and a category. Remember, a product can never be assigned directly to a user. There must be a
        category in-between them to create the relationship. The next class will complete the other side of this
        indirect relationship between the user and product by assigning the user (or group in our case) to the
        category.

    <p>
        We will be focusing on the <code class="script">create.js</code> script, but feel free to take a look at the others
        to see what kind of CRUD capabilities you have access to for Category Product Assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you are in the <code class="script">create.js</code> script, take a look at the object you will be creating stored
        in the <code class="var">assignment</code> variable. As you can see, it is a pretty simple object. It has a
        <code>CategoryID</code>, <code>ProductID</code>, and <code>ListOrder</code>. Additionally, a Category
        Product Assignment requires a <code>buyerID</code> as a parameter, represented in the first line.
        Fill in the <code>buyerID</code> for the buyer you recently created. Then
        fill in the <code>CategoryID</code> and <code>ProductID</code> with the first of three products you have
        created. Run when you are ready and do it again with the two other products that you created.
