        From this point on, it is important that you remember that every API call you make
        requires that an authentication token be set. As you know from the previous class on
        authentication, this token is stored in your browser cookies.

        Creating a Buyer is very easy. In fact, you are only required to provide a name of your
        new buyer when creating one. If you choose to do this, your new buyer's buyerID will be
        auto-generated, and 'Active' will be set to false. Creating a buyer uses the 'Buyers'
        service provided from the SDK. The 'Buyers' service is almost exclusively a set of
        the standard CRUD operations for buyers.

        Below is a look at a full Buyer object. As you can see, it is very minimal with only
        3 stored values at most,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 100px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.Buyers.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Take a look at the code block we have provided you to the right. Creating a buyer
        only requires a few lines of easily readable code (in fact, you could put it all
        in one line very easily).
    </p>
    <p>
        Go ahead and fill in the Name of your new buyer to the right. If you insist, you can add
        your own 'ID' along with your new buyer, but it is much easier if you just let it
        auto-generate. Finally , set 'Active' to true and your new buyer object is ready to go.
        Take note of the 'Buyers' service call with the 'Create' method, taking the new buyer
        object as the first and only parameter. This will make the request to OrderCloud and return
        your new full buyer object.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you run into any errors, read through the console on the right of the code block, as it should
        give you some verbose error messaging on what went wrong. But chances are good that you will
        have a successful call the first time!
