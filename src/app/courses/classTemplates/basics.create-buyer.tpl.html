    <p>
        A Buyer in OrderCloud is an organization or set of related users that <em>make orders</em> to
        a distributor (wholesaler, manufacturer, etc.) through an OrderCloud application, having a similar level
        of access and using a similar set of purchasing rules. A Buyer is one of the foundations of an OrderCloud
        application, because it often provides the <em>context</em> in which some other object is being defined
        (such as a user or category).
    </p>
    <p>
        Creating a Buyer is one of the most straightforward API Requests you will make in OrderCloud.
        In fact, you are only required to provide a name of your new buyer when creating one.
        If you choose to do this, your new buyer's <code>ID</code> will be auto-generated, and <code>Active</code> will
        be set to false. Creating a buyer uses the <em>Buyers</em> service provided from the SDK. The <em>Buyers</em>
        service, in turn, provides all the standard CRUD operations for dealing with Buyers.

    <p>
        Below is a look at a full Buyer object. As you can see, it is very minimal,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 100px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.Buyers.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Take a look at the code block we have provided you to the right. Creating a buyer
        only requires a few lines of code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Go ahead and fill in the Name of your new buyer to the right. Set the Buyer <code>ID</code> to
        whatever you like (we usually choose something readable), and set <code>Active</code> to true.
        Review the SDK service call, <code>Buyers.Create(buyer);</code>. This is the first of many
        SDK API Requests you will be making. The syntax is "Service.Method(params);" where the <em>Service</em>
        is synonymous with an OrderCloud resource, and the <em>Method</em> is synonymous with an OrderCloud endpoint.
        This particular operation will make the request to OrderCloud and return your new buyer object in full.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure you write down the <code>ID</code> of the buyer you are creating, as you will be using it in the next class.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you run into any errors, read through the console on the right of the code block, as it should
        give you some verbose error messaging on what went wrong. Also, make sure you write down the <code>ID</code>
        of the buyer you are creating, as you will be using it in the next class.
