    <p>
        Now for the final step of creating and using a group, assigning users to the user group. The typical
        first steps towards accessing any object as a buyer-user is to create the necessary objects
        and then assign them. This is the first of many <em>create and assign</em> combinations you will be executing.
        In fact, you will be creating three more objects and completing three more assignments in this course alone.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason assignments are explicitly defined outside of object creations is because OrderCloud
        is built as a <em>modular</em> API. Having to create and assign separately may seem like more work, but there
        is a very good reason for it. We want you to use exactly what you need to build an application for your
        company or your clients, and nothing more. If we started creating nested objects directly inside
        of other objects (such as products inside of a category or prices inside of a product), it
        would require you to use more than you really need, thus slowing down the development time
        and vastly reducing your ability to define a proper project scope (this is the crux of a SAAS application).
        And as an added plus, you will come to love the modular orientation of OrderCloud once you get deeper into
        your application because the separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and intuitively
        understand the structure of your B2B environment.

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating a Group Assignment</h3>
    <p>
        A full group assignment object is shown below,
    </p>
    <div readonly
         ui-ace="{
      onLoad: class.setMaxLines,
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.UserGroups.SaveMemberAssignment.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Taking a look at the <code class="script">create.js</code> script, you can see what is required to
        create a new Group assignment. Start by replacing the <code class="var">buyerID</code> variable with
        the ID of the new buyer you created earlier in this course. In the <code class="var">assignment</code> variable,
        a sample request object is currently stored with 3 values--<code>UserGroupID</code>, <code>UserID</code>,
        and <code>BuyerID</code>. You can take out the <code>BuyerID</code> object, as we won't need that (and
        it is already stated in the parameter value).
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be assigning two of your three new users to this group. You have two options to accomplish this.
        Your first option is to process the <code class="script">create.js</code> script twice with each of the users you
        are assigning. The second and more challenging option is to create a second assignment object (with a different
        variable name, of course) and process a second SDK call in the same script with the new assignment object.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are ready, go ahead and process the request by hitting "Run".
