    <p>
        Creating a group is an easy and powerful way to give a subset of users the same access to a
        set of products, categories, pricing, permissions, and many other configurations that apply
        to a collection of users. They are easy to create and maintain, but most importantly, they are
        flexible. They manage to be flexible in two major ways. First, a user can be assigned to any amount
        of groups, whether that be 0, 1, or many. This means one user can have a combination of permissions
        from a mix of whatever groups they are assigned to. If group 1 has access to category A, and
        group 2 has access to category B, a user assigned to both gains access to both category A and B.
        Second, a group is given similar behaviors as a user. This means a group can be used in place of
        a user for nearly every assignment (category assignment, product assignment, address assignment,
        etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
        What this flexibility means is that you can more easily create and scale an application with a
        massive or growing user base without sacrificing functionality due to administration getting out
        of hand. We urge you to create and use groups as often as you can, as it will help decrease
        the time it creates to build an administrative application, make it easier for the admin users
        to manage users, and even make it easier to allow buyer-users to self-administer.

        A full user object has more stored values than what you saw in the buyer object,
        as you can see below,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 200px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.Groups.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Take a look at the code block we have provided you to the right. You will see across the top all of
        the CRUD operation scripts, but for now we will be focusing on creating a new user in the
        <code class="script">create.js</code> script. As you can see inside of <code class="script">create.js</code>,
        you have a full user object like the one above stored in a variable called <code class="var">var user</code>.
        There are three important pieces to this script that will eventually be used together to create your first user.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, you have <code class="var">var buyerID</code>, which is the variable in which you will store the
        ID of the buyer you will be using as the <em>context</em> for this user. Go ahead and replace
        <code class="string">"{buyerID}"</code> with the ID of the buyer you created in the previous class.
        Make sure you store this value as a string or you will run into an error processing the code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, you have <code class="var">var user</code>, which is the variable storing the new user object
        you will be creating. Go ahead and fill out everything from <code>ID</code> to <code>Phone</code> with
        whatever you like. Note that it is important that your ID, Username, and Password do not have any spaces
        (non-alphanumeric values are ok), and the Email be in the format of a standard email address. Once you
        are done with this, leave <code>TermsAccepted</code> and <code>xp</code> to null. Finally, set
        <code>Active</code> to true. It is important that you set this to active or you will not be able to gain
        access to the products, categories, and other objects you should be able to when authenticating as one
        of these users (you can of course always update a user who is inactive to make them active).
    </p>
    <p>
        And finally, on line 18 of the code block in <code class="script">create.js</code>, we have the SDK
        call to create the User. This SDK Service Method takes two parameters, the <code class="var">buyerID</code>
        and <code class="var">user</code> variables, in that order.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend you write down each of the new users <code>ID</code>, <code>Username</code>, and <code>Password</code>
        somewhere so you can refer to them in later classes. Remember to read through the response console
        to work through any errors if you run into any trouble!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are ready, go ahead and process the request by hitting "Run". You will need to create 3 new users
        before you continue to the next course.
