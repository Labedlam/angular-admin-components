    <p>
        One of the challenges you will encounter while working with OrderCloud is understanding the
        context in which the new objects you create are defined. Specific rules like being able
        to use a product across multiple buyers, but not being able to use a category across multiple
        buyers, or understanding the assignments required to give a user access to a specific product
        are all advanced topics, but end up being the backbone of what makes OrderCloud such a powerful
        platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first example of this defined 'context' is within a user object. A user object must be
        defined under the context of a buyer. In other words, one user object must be 'under' one
        and only one buyer. This rule is very logical and easy to understand, so it provides a good
        starting point for developing your understanding of these context rules. We will explain these
        contexts as we move through the beginner courses, and eventually you will be an expert!

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating a New User</h3>
    <p>
        A full user object has more stored values than what you saw in the buyer object,
        as you can see below,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 200px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.Users.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        As usual, the ID will be auto-generated if you do not provide one yourself.
        Take a look at the code block we have provided you to the right. We have provided you with
        a basic user object with the values that are either required or highly recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are ready, go ahead and fill in the values in the <code>user</code> object. Make sure
        you don't leave any blank or with the <code>'...'</code> placeholder.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember to read through the response console to work through any errors if you run into any trouble!
