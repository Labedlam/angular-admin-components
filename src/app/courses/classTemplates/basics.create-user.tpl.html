    <p>
        One of the challenges you will encounter while working with OrderCloud is understanding the
        context in which the new objects you create are defined. Specific rules like being able
        to use a product across multiple buyers, but not being able to use a category across multiple
        buyers, or understanding the assignments required to give a user access to a specific product
        are all advanced topics, but end up being the backbone of what makes OrderCloud such a powerful
        platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first example of this defined "context" is within a user object. A user object must be
        defined under the context of a buyer. In other words, one user object must be <em>under</em> one
        and only one buyer. This specific rule is pretty logical and straight forward, so it provides a good
        starting point for developing your understanding of these context rules. We will explain these
        contexts as we move through the each course, and eventually you will be an expert!

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating a New User</h3>
    <p>
        A full user object has more stored values than what you saw in the buyer object,
        as you can see below,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 200px;" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.Users.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        Take a look at the code block we have provided you to the right. You will see the full
        request object, but you do not need to touch every value (some will stay as their default. Fill
        in everything from <code>ID</code> to <code>Phone</code> with whatever values you would like. Leave
        <code>TermsAccepted</code> and <code>xp</code> null, and set <code>Active</code> to true.
    </p>
    <p>
        One difference you will notice between this class and the <em>Create a Buyer</em> class is that there is
        an extra parameter in the SDK call. In addition to the request object (<code>var user</code> in this
        case), you also need to provide a <code>buyerID</code> for the user to be created under. This was explained
        above in the <em>What You Need To Know</em> section, and is manifested by including this ID as the first
        parameter in the SDK call. Take the <code>ID</code> of the buyer you created in the previous class and
        store it inside of <code>var buyerID</code>, where "{buyerID}" is currently sitting as a placeholder.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure you keep a note on your new User's ID, username, and password, as you will be using it to change
        contexts in an upcoming class (and in other courses as well). Remember to read through the response console
        to work through any errors if you run into any trouble!
