        Now that you have created a buyer, a few users under that buyer, and generated a successful API
        Access Claim giving your buyer-users the ability to authenticate on the client-site, you are ready
        to sign in as a buyer user and truly begin your journey in OrderCloud. The goal if this page is
        for you to get the current authenticated users basic information. This is possible through the use
        of the 'Me' service, which will be one of your most powerful tools when building the buyer-site. To
        get to the point where use the 'Me' service in this class, you first need to set your clientID to
        match the clientID you just received in your Buyer Api Access Claim response (select below).
    </p>
    <pre><code>Select clientID</code></pre>
    <p>
        Now pick one of your users that you recently created a few classes back,
    </p>
    <pre><code>Select User</code></pre>
    <button>authenticate as user</button>
    <p>
        Great! You are now authenticated as {{class.current.name}}. Now you are ready to run the code block
        to the right, and you will get a response with the current authenticated users information. As you can
        see, it's only one line of code... that's it!!! Go ahead and click run when you are ready and you
        should see the response with the current users information.
