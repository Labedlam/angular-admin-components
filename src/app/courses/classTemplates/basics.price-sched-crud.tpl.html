        Creating a Price Schedule is the next step towards creating your first catalog. Price Schedules fill an
        important role in OrderCloud, because they, along with the proper product-assignment, create an
        <em>instance</em> of a product that can be exposed to a buyer-application. Think of the product itself
        as a <em>prototype</em> or a <em>class</em> you would see in an OOP language. The combination of that
        product prototype with a price schedule and product-assignment creates an instance that can be used
        and exposed in an application.

    <div readonly
         ui-ace="{
      onLoad: class.setMaxLines,
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',

      useSoftTabs: true

        As you can see, the price schedule object has some more depth than you have seen so far. You can learn more
        about what each of these values mean in the documentation, but for now we will focus on the basics
        of creating a price schedule.

    <p>
        You will be updating the <code>ID</code>, <code>Name</code> values, and <code>PriceBreaks</code> array.
        Set the <code>ID</code> and <code>Name</code> to whatever you like. In the <code>PriceBreaks</code> array,
        you will need to define at least one set of price breaks. For now, we will keep it simple and define a
        standard price break for a product with one price for all quantities. Leave the
        <code>Quantity</code> value at 0 and set the <code>Price</code> to an arbitrary number of your choosing. Note that setting
        <code>Quantity</code> to 0 is simply telling the system that for any quantity above 0, set the price to
        that of the price value stored in the same object.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the neat things about price schedules is that they are unrestricted. This means you can use one price
        schedule for any number of products. This is helpful for times when a set of different products has the same
        set of pricing rules, where you only have to define the price schedule in one location instead of many.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use this concept for each of the products you have recently created. This means you only have to create
        one price schedule. Go ahead and fill out the <code class="var">ps</code> variable object in the
        <code class="script">create.js</code> script and run.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once again, after you run this script, make sure you take note of the <code>ID</code>, or you will have to
        go find it in the API Console!

        When are ready, hit 'Run'!
