        Now that you have a product, price schedule, and user/group defined and ready to work with, let's complete
        the final step to make your first 'product instance'. The classes you have completed so far have created
        the necessary pieces to make a proper product assignment that creates a relationship between the
        three, and ultimately create a 'product instance'. After this class, we will complete building your
        first catalog by creating a category and making the necessary assignments so your new users can actually
        access the products they are supposed to have access to.

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating a Product Assignment</h3>
    <p>
        In the <code class="script">create.js</code> script, you will see a variable, <code class="var">assignment</code>,
        and the SDK call. As you can see in this variable, there are six different values.
        We will only be using three of the six to create the assignment. To learn more about all of these values,
        review the documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start by removing the values we don't need. Remove <code>ReplenishmentPriceScheduleID</code>,
        <code>UserID</code>, and <code>BuyerID</code>. Now that you have the three values you need--<code>ProductID</code>,
        <code>StandardPriceSchedule</code>, and <code>UserGroupID</code>--you are ready to set the assignments.
        Fill out the <code>StandardPriceSchedule</code> with your newly created Price Schedule ID. Do the same with the
        <code>UserGroupID</code> with your newly created UserGroup ID.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you fill out the <code>ProductID</code>, you should know that you will need to create 3 different
        product assignments in this class, for each of the 3 products that you created in an earlier class. Go ahead
        and fill out the <code>ProductID</code> object with each of these 3 new product's ID's and process the
        <code class="script">create.js</code> for each one.
    </p>
