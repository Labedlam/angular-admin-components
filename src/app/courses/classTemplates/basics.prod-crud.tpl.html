    <p>
        The next step towards creating a catalog is to create a few products. What makes a product unique in
        terms of its orientation is that it is not defined under the context of a buyer, like a user
        or a category (as you will see shortly). This buyer autonomy means that you can use one product across
        multiple buyers without having to create a new one.

        You will get a hang of these idiosyncrasies as you continue to build your B2B environment with OrderCloud. For now,
        we will focus on creating your first product, followed by creating the necessary assignments to make
        the product accessible.

    <h3 class="page-title">Creating a Product</h3>
    <p>
        Below is a sample of a new product request object,
    </p>
    <div readonly
         ui-ace="{
      onLoad: class.setMaxLines,
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'twilight',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="class.docs.Products.Create.RequestBody.Sample"></div>
    <p>
        We will focus on the <code class="script">create.js</code> script. As you can see, there is an entire product object set inside
        the <code>prod</code> variable. To create the new product, you only need to set the <code>ID</code>,
        <code>Description</code>, <code>Name</code>, <code>QuantityMultiplier</code>, and <code>Active</code> values.
        Everything else is up to you, but we recommend you focus on the fundamentals right now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Set the <code>ID</code>, <code>Description</code>, and <code>Name</code> to whatever you like. Set the
        <code>QuantityMultiplier</code> to 1 or more, and set <code>Active</code> to true. Note that in order
        for a buyer-user to access a product, it MUST be active.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that you have completed the configuration, review the code block. Note that the service
        call to create a Product is, <code class="var">Products.Create(prod);</code>, where "prod" is the new object you are
        creating, and the only parameter in the method call.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will need to create 3 new products in order to successfully complete this class. Go ahead and create 3 new
        products when you are ready. Make sure that each of the new products has its own separate <code>ID</code>.
        You should also write down the <code>ID</code> of each of your new products to be used later. If you'd like,
        you can use the <code class="script">list.js</code> script to generate the list of products you have created
        once you are done creating your 3 new products.
    </p>
