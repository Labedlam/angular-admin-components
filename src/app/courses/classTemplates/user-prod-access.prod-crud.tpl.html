    <p>
        In this course you will be walking through the necessary steps to make a product accessible to a buyer-user
        on your buyer side application. You will be working with three types of objects and 2 types of assignments,
        all of which are necessary for your buyer-user to gain access to a product.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the culmination of this course, you will get the chance to authenticate as a buyer-user and check
        if they have access to the product. If you follow closely, you won't have any trouble. Pay close
        attention to the <em>What You Need To Know</em> section, as we will explain some of the different rules and
        options you have when working with buyer-user product access beyond this course.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you get started, you will want to write down the userID of the user you plan on working with.
        This will help you keep track of things during this course, so you won't have to start over. If you
        do not have any users, step out of this course and create a user in one of two ways: Create a user
        in the <a ui-sref>API Console</a>, or, Take the <a ui-sref="^.basics">Basics</a> course, where we will help
        you create a basic environment, including your first user.
    </p>
    <h3 class="page-title">Authenticating your Admin User</h3>
    <p>
        On the right, we have setup a short script for you to authenticate your distributor user. All you need
        to do is enter your 'Username' and 'Password' in their respective locations. The
        <code>Credentials.Get(creds);</code> function call will take care of everything else for you, including sending the
        request to get your access token, and storing the token in your browser cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you have filled in your Username and Password, go ahead and click 'Run'. If you get an error, make
        sure that you are using the credentials of a Distributor User and not a Buyer User.
