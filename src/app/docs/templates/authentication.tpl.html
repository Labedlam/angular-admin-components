<h3 class="page-title">OAuth 2 Authentication</h3>
<div>
    OrderCloud API authentication is based on OAuth 2 and supports 2 different workflows, or, in OAuth terms, grant types. In both workflows, a successful authorization request returns an access token, valid for a limited amount of time, that is passed via a request header in all subsequent requests to the OrderCloud API.

<h3 class="page-header">OAuth 2 Workflows</h3>
<!--	<p>In both OAuth 2 grant types, a successful authorization request returns an access token, valid for a limited amount of time, that is passed via a request header in all subsequent requests to the OrderCloud API.</p>-->
<p><b>Both</b> OAuth 2 grant types use the following Method and Request URL:</p>
<div class="apiRequestDisplay">
    <pre>POST</pre>
    <pre>https://auth.ordercloud.io/oauth/token</pre>
</div>

<h4 class="page-title">Password Grant Type</h4>
<p>This workflow is most appropriate for client apps where the user is a human being, i.e., a registered OrderCloud Buyer or Admin user. You should have received a Client ID when you registered your application; you'll need it for this workflow, along the username/password of a user created via the API. Begin by requesting a token from the authorization server using the following as a template for your request body:</p>

<pre>client_id=a<span tooltip="The desired client ID">xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</span>&amp;grant_type=password&amp;<span tooltip="The desired users' credentials">username=xxxxxxxx&amp;password=xxxxxxxx</span>&amp;scope=FullAccess</pre>
<br/>

<h4 class="page-title">Client Credentials Grant Type</h4>
<p>This workflow is most appropriate for back-end integrations where the "user" is a non-human. It is also appropriate when you are just getting started and need to "seed" your application with users who can subsequently authenticate using the Password Grant type. You should have recieved a Client ID and Client Secret when you registered your application; you'll need both for this workflow. Begin by requesting a token from the authorization server using the following template for your request body:</p>

<pre>client_id=<span tooltip="The desired client ID">xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</span>&amp;grant_type=client_credentials&amp;client_secret=xxxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;scope=FullAccess</pre>
<br/>

<h4>Response</h4>
<p>In both grant types, if the authorization is successful, an access token will be present in the access_token field in the JSON response body:</p>
<pre>{"access_token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."}</pre>
<p>This access token must then be passed in the <code>Authorization</code> header for all subsequent calls to the API. For example:</p>

<div class="apiRequestDisplay">
    <pre>POST</pre>
    <pre>https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/buyers/mybuyer/users</pre>
</div>

<p>Headers: <code>{Content-Type: 'application/json', Authorization: 'Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...'}</code></p>
