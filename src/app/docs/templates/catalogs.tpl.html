<h3 class="page-title">Catalogs</h3>
<p>
    Catalogs are a collection of products and rules exposed to an organization constructed for their specific ordering experience.  Sometimes a catalog may be a "store" where users purchase products that are presented.  In other cases, catalogs may house complex order management scenarios that simplify ordering for users and allow them to quickly create an order based on pre-defined business rules.
