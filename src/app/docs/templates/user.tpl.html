    Many resources in the OrderCloud API are concerned with creating "Things" (Products, Addresses, etc.) and assigning them to Companies, Users, and Groups. These resources provide administrators with fine-grained management of these assignments. But in order to build a robust end-user experience, it is crucial to have a fast, easy way to flatten the hierarchy and get a list of Things that the current User can see, regardless of exactly how they can see them. This is the role of the Buyer Perspective resource, or what we like to call "Me". In some cases, richer models will be returned from these endpoints. For example, a Product may have multiple Price Schedules, but a buyer user will only see one of them, so it is included as a sub-object of Product.
