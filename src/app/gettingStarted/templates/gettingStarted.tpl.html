                This guide is geared towards developers who want to get up and running with the OrderCloud API and start
                creating their first application with the OrderCloud Seed repository. While your development environment
                is up to you, Four51's IDE of choice is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/"><b>WebStorm</b></a> and works well with all of the tools below.

        <p>
            The OrderCloud Seed depends on a few third party code libraries that you will need to install locally before
            you can jump into the code. It isn't necessary to learn the full workings of any
            of these libraries to get started, only to install them.

        <h4><b>Installing <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a></b></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Follow the link above to the Node home page. This page should display green download buttons specific
                for the OS you are currently using. At the time of writing this guide Node has two versions available, a
                long term support (LTS) version 4.2.2 and a staple version of 5.0.0. Either version should be fine for
                working with our application. Click on the appropriate button to begin downloading Node.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the application as finished downloading, click on the downloaded file and walk though the
                installation guide. All the defaults should be fine.
            </li>
            <li>
                The installation of node should take care of installing npm as well. If you want to verify the install
                open up a terminal or command prompt window and type <code>node --version</code> and your current version
                of node should read out. You can do the same check with npm by typing <code>npm --version</code>. If there
                was no error during your installation but these commands do not work you may need to add node and/or npm
                to your environment variables.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4><b>Installing <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a></b></h4>
        <p>
            The seed uses Bower to add functionality from other code libraries to the code you are developing. Examples
            of things included in the seed through Bower are AngularJS, Bootstrap, and the OrderCloud-Angular-SDK.
        </p>
        <p>
            To install Bower, just run <code>npm install -g bower</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure you don't forget the "-g", this is telling npm to install the package globally so it will be available
            to you for all future projects.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Installing <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp 4.0</a></b></h4>
        <p>
            The seed relays on Gulp for its automation tests when setting up the app. It uses the 4.0 version of Gulp
            which at the time of writing this guide has not been officially released, but fear not! Now that you have npm
            installed installing Gulp will be a breeze. Add you need is to open up your terminal and type one line:
        </p>
        <p><code>
            npm -g install "gulpjs/gulp-cli#4.0"
        </code></p>
        <p>
            Again make sure you include the "-g". Now with all the third party stuff installed you are finally ready to get the
            OrderCloud Seed code.
        </p>
        <h3 class="page-header">Getting the Seed</h3>
        <p>
            Four51's code is available online through GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub account yet you are going to need
            to <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">create one</a>, don't worry it is free.
        </p>
        <p>
            To access the OrderCloud seed through GitHub you can use the URL provided here: <a href="https://github.com/Four51/OrderCloud-Seed-AngularJS" target="_blank">OrderCloud-Seed-AngularJS</a>, or search GitHub
            for OrderCloud-Seed-AngularJS. Make sure that the code you are downloading is under the Four51 GitHub user.
        </p>
        <p>
            There many options for interfacing with GitHub including the GitHub desktop and SourceTree. You can look up
            these tools on your own. For this guide we will just be assuming that you downloaded the zipped version of the
            app from GitHub and have unzipped the directory.
        </p>
        <h3 class="page-header">Final Steps</h3>
        <p>Its the home stretch. Just a few more things to do and your app will be up and running.</p>
        <p>
            To ensure your setup works, build your application and then run it with the following commands:
        </p>
        <p><code>gulp build</code></p>
        <p><code>gulp watch</code></p>
        <p>
            The built files are placed in the <code>build/</code> directory by default. Add the <code>watch</code> should open the application on a localhost on port 8000.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>watch</code> actually starts a few other processes in the background to help you develop your application. Using
            <code>browser-sync</code> and some built in gulp functions the app is now watching for changes in your source directory.
            Should you make any changes to your html or js files the app should automatically reload your application
            with the appropriate changes. Also if you make any changes to your style sheets (less or css) the app will
            rebuild those changes and inject them directly into the application, without reloading the entire page!
        </p>
        <p>
            When you're ready to push your app into production, just run the <code>compile</code> command:
        </p>
        <p><code>gulp compile</code></p>
        <p>
            This will concatenate and minify your sources and place them by default into the <code>compile/</code> directory. There
            will only be three files (excluding assets): <code>index.html</code>, <code>OrderCloud.js</code>, and <code>OrderCloud.css</code>. All of the
            vendor dependencies like AngularJS styles and the OrderCloud-SDK itself have been added to them for
            super-easy deploying. If you use any assets (<code>src/assets/</code>) then they will be copied to <code>compile/</code> as is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, a complete build is always available by simply running the default task, which runs <code>build</code> and then <code>compile</code>:
        </p>
        <p><code>gulp</code></p>
